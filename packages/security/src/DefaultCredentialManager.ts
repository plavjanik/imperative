 * Default Credential Manager is our implementation of the Imperative Credential Manager. This manager invokes methods

 * ### Keychains Used by Keytar
 *
 * | OS | Vault |
 * |----|----------|
 * | Windows | Credential Vault |
 * | macOS | Keychain |
 * | Linux | Secret Sevice API/libsecret |
 *
 * ### Keytar must be installed by the app using imperative (like zowe-cli).
 *
 * On Linux, Keytar will not work out of the box without some additional
 * configuration to install libsecret. Keytar provides the following
 * documentation for Linux users to install libsecret:
 *
 * ---
 *
 * Depending on your distribution, you will need to run the following command:
 *
 * - Debian/Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install libsecret-1-dev`
 * - Red Hat-based: `sudo yum install libsecret-devel`
 * - Arch Linux: `sudo pacman -S libsecret`
